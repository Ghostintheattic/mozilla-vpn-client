 * initialize.
 *
 * 1. When "something" is an addon:
 *
 * The state of an addon is a collection of properties that can change how the
 * addon is presented or how it behaves.
 *
 * A given addon's state is defined in it's manifest under the `state` key. In
 * practice, it is a dictionary of key/value pairs. The keys are strings and the
 * values may be either boolean, numbers or strings. The keys are not dinamic.
 * The values can be changed, but the kays are limited to whatever is defined in
 * the addon manifest. The type of the value cannot be changed.
